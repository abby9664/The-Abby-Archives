                If you're creating some sort of visual representation of an original character (OC) and you're stuck on their clothing's color scheme, go here for inspiration! This website has an internal algorithm that generates a color scheme based on the personality
                of your OC.
                <!--<br> Instructions:-->
                <!--<ol>-->
                <!--    <li></li>-->
                <!--</ol>-->
                The design does look ugly, but it will be improved later, once the algorithm is working properly.

        <h1>About the Colors</h1>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Happy/optimistic:</strong> The color range spans from yellow to cyan, because I feel like yellow, green, and cyanish colors represent happiness. Yellow reminds people of sunlight, green reminds most people of sprouts and plants, and
                cyan is similar to the color of a bright sky. The colors are pretty saturated and I make the lightness roughly in the middle in between light and dark to make the colors as pure as possible.</li>
            <li><strong>Melancholy:</strong> The resulting color schemes are mostly blues, purples, and grays, which are very cool colors and stand out less than warm and bright colors. Blue also symbolizes sadness and tears, like Sadness in the movie <em>Inside Out</em>.
                The colors are dark and have a very low saturation to show that there's a lack of energy in the character. </li>
            <li><strong>Aggressive:</strong> The palette consist of reds and oranges. Red symbolizes passion, anger, and power. Orange is also a fiery color that builds that emotion. I extended the range to include deep colors, which are more emotional than
                bright or pallid colors. Yes, bright colors have lots of energy, but deep colors add emotion to the character and also makes bright colors pop out more.</li>
            <li><strong>Bitter:</strong> I asked several people, who think that bitterness is associated with dark yellows and greens. So I made the colors dark and sometimes unsaturated. The final result is an ugly color that I feel shows how twisted, envious,
                and resentful the character is.</li>
            <li><strong>Calm:</strong> There are mostly cool colors (greens, blues, and purples) to show that the character has less energy, but the colors are less dark and more mellow to give an air of friendliness and chill positivity. There is more color
                than the very dull, grayscale melancholy color schemes to show that the character is more optimistic.</li>
            <li><strong>Accent colors:</strong> I tried to use analogous colors with high saturations but with the same lightness, because accent colors tend to stand out more. However, sometimes, the colors donâ€™t match. The algorithm will be fixed soon.</li>
        </ul>
